# Deep Learning Approaches for the Protein Scaffold Filling

Repository for my paper published in 2022 IEEE International Conference on Tools in Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)
titled "Deep Learning Approaches for the Protein Scaffold Filling Problem"

## Installing Dependencies:
Install anaconda or miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Tested on conda version 23.1.0

I created an env.yml to allow you to run conda create -n <yourenv> --file env.yml, but it was not working, so here are the steps to install:

    conda create env -n <yourenv>
    conda activate <yourenv>
    conda install pip
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0   # Only if you want to run on a GPU (must install CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN)
    pip install "tensorflow<2.10"                               # Version matters for running GPU only
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install PyMuPDF
    pip install reportlab

## Environment Variables:

It is necessary to have PYTHONHASHSEED = 1 in your environment variables *before* the python interpreter launches to fix the randomness to produce exactly my results.

Once environment variable is set, confirm by running this with your python interpreter to see if it returns True:

    python -c "import os; print(os.environ.get('PYTHONHASHSEED') == '1')"

## Running the application:

Once environment is configured, just run python main.py. The script will generate all results into a folder called /results. It reads from the data in /data

## Breakdown of the files:

### Directories
- data: contains the target_sequence, the denovo_sequence, and the training data collected from NCBI
- fonts: used by a function in utility.py to print monospace fonts for graphics
- results: contains result of running the program
- results_on_paper: contains my original results used for data in our published paper (for comparison)

### Files
- main.py: entry point for the program. Run this to generate results in /results
- utility.py: module imported by main.py. Contains useful functions
- env.yml: environment file generated by conda from my environment. Does not appear to work very well, but it's here to record the precise dependencies
